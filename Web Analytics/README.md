Web Analytics Roadmap
-------------------------

With web analytics, marketers have a wide array of data at their disposal but it can often be difficult making sense of. The internet is a dynamic environment 
that offers businesses, small and large, access to customers. But if you don’t know enough about how your website is being used, you’ll lose the ability to 
address your customers’ needs.

Analytics may have the answer to these questions. Google Analytics, a free web-based tool enables marketers to track traffic statistics on their websites. 
Its interface and features may seem complicated at first, but once you get to grips with the tools you’ll be able to see the benefits. 


What Is Web Analytics Strategy?
--------------------------------------
The web analytics strategy is a process of churning out all the important parameters of your business strategy and integrating it with your 
data analytics. These seem like an obvious strategy, but many companies are missing on this important step. Each business has its own KPI’s and the 
analytic strategy is focused on optimizing those parameters.


There are three key areas you can focus on-
----------------------------------------------------

1. Build a picture of your customers and develop a strategy to ensure it is targeted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can learn a lot about your customers through a simple snapshot:

- the number of page views,

- visitor demographics,

- how many of those views are new or returning readers,

- which pages they visited,

- the average time spent on your site or page,

- the bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who enter the site and "bounce" or leave the site, rather than staying to view other pages within the same site) or

- the exit rate (the percentage of visitors who click away to a different site from a specific page, after possibly having visited other pages on the site).

The longer someone stays on your site, the more engaged they are. By getting an overview of what content people are reading, you're better placed to develop your content and provide more of the material people enjoy reading.

Understanding how traffic moves to your site, around your site and then off your site gives you a roadmap of how the pages are being used. You can get a picture of how they found your site in the first place and the pages they were interested in reading, for example by looking at the incoming links - site visitors might have come from social media, a search engine or another website that has linked to your website. You can then tailor marketing campaigns to the interests of your customers.



2. Understand what devices your customers are using
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you haven’t browsed through the devices report before, you may be intrigued with how customers are interacting with your site. The report provides a breakdown of your site traffic by device type used - desktop, mobile or tablet -- over a period of time. You can track trends over time and this may affect your marketing decisions in the future. For example, if your customers are increasingly visiting your site on their mobile phone or tablet, then you may want to consider a responsive design for your website to make it easier for them to view on a small screen. Or you may want to consider providing media that works well on mobile devices such as embedded videos or podcasts that customers can easily consume on the go.

Gaining deeper insight into how your visitors access your website will enlighten and maybe even spark some new marketing ideas.



3. Analyse visitor paths
--------------------------------

Flow reports show the paths users take through your content step-by-step. Essentially, it shows trends in which pages people have visited in a particular order. The benefit of flow reports is they allow you to see the volume of users at each step and the rate of abandonment at those steps. You can then get an idea of how users are moving around their site and at what point they lose interest or get drawn away to another website. By understanding visitor paths you can design better content or online sales processes to keep customers on your site for longer.

Without focus you could spend days lost in analytics, so you need to create a roadmap and define where you're heading. 
Find out what is most important to your business and track it. It's a shortcut to not only improving your website, but improving your customer relations.




Strategy to Create a Robust Web Analytics-
-----------------------------------------------



Determine Your Primary Business Goals
---------------------------------------------

To develop effective web analytics and measurement strategy, you need to first determine the primary goals of your website. Whether it’s boosting the ROI or decreasing the overheads. In other words, why does your web properties exist? If you want to measure success you need to set some parameters and metrics.

Websites with the focus of increasing the revenue are involved in the promotion of products and service in order to boost their online/offline purchases.

Businesses which do not sell online products/service such as healthcare, daycare service focus on increasing the number of qualified leads they generate.

Inefficient businesses focus on decreasing the overall cost of conversion. For example – E-Commerce businesses may like to decrease the cost of conversion by decreasing the number of steps required for purchase. Analytics measurement helps businesses to understand where exactly customer bouncing out.

Focus on Conversions
Increased Page views, number of sessions, and traffic is an indicator that your website content is performing well but those are not indicators of website success. More relevant parameter of measuring website success is how users are engaging with your website. For example – E-commerce website attracting huge traffic on the product pages but failing to convert them is a sign of failure. Your analytic measurement strategy should focus on optimizing the website pages to boost conversion. This should always be your primary goal.

Every marketing penny you spend should help you achieve your goal directly or indirectly. Thus focusing on conversions is the key. Based on your business and goals the conversions could be –

Filling a form
Registering for an event
Downloading E-book/PDF
Signing up for trial sessions
Viewing a video
Signing up for newsletter
Purchasing a product etc.


Selecting Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s)
---------------------------------------------------

Today’s businesses are moving towards smart data rather than big data. More than half the data acquired turns useless. Hence defining your key performance indicators is an important aspect of web analytics strategy.

Building on the foundation of boosting conversions, data must be gathered to select actionable KPI’s.

For example – If your goal is to create brand awareness and you witness an increase in the number of visits on your page has increased by 30% This is a good sign. Here your page views or social media visits is the KPI.

Likewise, if your website goal is to increase the revenue and you find that the thank you page of your website is receiving higher traffic, it means your website is doing well. Here the conversion rate is your KPI.

Some example of KPI’s can be –

Number of conversions per month
Number of qualified leads acquired
Percentage increase in traffic in a specified time
The average number of people signed up for the event
Well defined KPI’s acts like a report card for a business. If the obtained results vary from your defined strategies you can optimize them to perform better. 
It is crucial for a business to have a sound strategy to define these key metrics. It requires your business to have a great understanding of marketing, management and technical teams. The choice for KPI’s can differ from industry to industry and the aspect of the business you are trying to improve. The definition of KPI’s is critical for your business and hence finds an important value in your web analytics and measurement strategy.


Integrate Your Marketing Platforms
-----------------------------------------
There are tremendous opportunities when you tie-up your analytical tool with other marketing tools such as customer relationship management (CRM), email list, phone list and your business repository. Integrating all these tools will give you a clear picture of all your marketing activities, campaign performances and optimization opportunities. A well-integrated system keeps all the departments in check and could uncover touchpoints and how visitors are segmented.


Decide on Segmentation and Reporting
-------------------------------------------
Once you set your web analytics strategy and your analytic segments tool starts gathering data, it may get overwhelming to predict any useful transactions. Navigating through this huge amount of data can be tiring and a huge waste of time. Hence you need to put filters and extract only useful data from your tool.

Data segmentation is a powerful feature. It helps you gather valuable insights and take opportunity accordingly. The data you choose to segment depends upon your KPI’s and business goals.


Review Your Strategy on a Timely Basis
-------------------------------------------

It is vital that you revisit your strategy, KPI’s and business goals in order to summarize your progress and find optimization opportunities. Only a close analysis will tell you whether your campaign needs changes or not.

The sole aim of creating a web analytic strategy is to give an actionable data-driven approach that helps you measure user engagement with your website. The data will highlight important weaknesses and strength of your website and you need to attack those things accordingly. No strategy is 100% perfect hence revisiting your old methods could really help you a lot.

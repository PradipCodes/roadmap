Content Marketing Roadmap
--------------------------------

What is content marketing ?
Content marketing is a marketing strategy used to attract, engage, and retain an audience by creating and sharing relevant articles, videos, podcasts, and other media. 
This approach establishes expertise, promotes brand awareness, and keeps your business top of mind when it’s time to buy what you sell.

It is the development and distribution of relevant, useful content—blogs, newsletters, white papers, social media posts, emails, videos, and the like—to current and potential customers. 

When it’s done right, this content conveys expertise and makes it clear that a company values the people to whom it sells.
The consistent use of content marketing establishes and nurtures relationships with your prospective and existing customers. When your audience thinks of your company as a partner interested in their success and a valuable source of advice and guidance, they’re more likely to choose you when it’s time to bu

Content strategy is the high-level planning, execution, governance, and on-going management of the content lifecycle to support key business initiatives. 
Essentially, it’s your brand’s game plan to drive traffic, leads, engagement, sales, and other business outcomes through content.


Factors to content marketing success

Document your content strategy
--------------------------------
This is the easiest one of all. So just get it done.


Publish quality content consistently
------------------------------------------
Publishers publish every day. So must brand publishers – on each category of content and topic you cover.


Map content to consumer journey
--------------------------------
There are many more people in the early stages of the buyer journey than there are people who are ready to buy. 
You have to understand how people move from asking “what is” and “why is this important” questions to “how do I do it,” “who does it,” and “how much does it cost?” Balance your content production accordingly. Most brands focus too much time, energy, and resources on the fewer late-stage consumers.


Balance paid, owned, and earned media
--------------------------------
The best content marketers start with owned content to see what resonates on social and creates customer engagement. Then they bet on the winners with paid media.


Focus on subscriptions
--------------------------------
Subscriptions are like magic. They sit between reach, engagement, and conversion. They act as an amazing lever for optimization. We have shown that subscribers convert to something that a business truly values (leads, e-commerce sales, event registrations, etc.) at as much as 10 times the rate of the average non-subscribing content consumer.

Track content marketing ROI
--------------------------------
It makes sense that those who are able to show ROI start with a strong business case and then simply commit to measuring their progress.



How to develop a content strategy ---
-------------------------------------



1. Establish your content goals
-----------------------------------

Before you launch any new content marketing strategy, it’s important to establish clear business goals and KPIs. After all, without goals you can’t develop a strategy, measure program success, or communicate ROI to company stakeholders.


Focus on outcomes
Goals compel action and drive your content strategy, so build your goals around the outcomes you want to achieve.


Determine the right goals for your brand
Are you looking to drive rankings?

If so, to what extent?

Looking to drive traffic?

How much traffic?

Are you looking to reach a specific audience segment?

Which segment and how will you measure your reach?

Looking to drive conversions?

How will you measure conversions, how many do you need to see, and by when?

Looking to drive engagement?

What kind of engagement?

When setting goals, experts agree that you’ll achieve more by following a two-tier structure: stretch goals and S.M.A.R.T. goals.

Stretch Goals vs. S.M.A.R.T. Goals
Stretch goals are aspirational. These are often major quarterly or annual milestones designed to push your team to achieve more ambitious outcomes.
S.M.A.R.T. goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-constrained (having a clear deadline). Consider these your process goals to ensure that you do the necessary tasks to achieve your stretch goals.
These two types of goals support each other and help to define your strategy. For example, imagine that your stretch goal is to increase organic website traffic to your content by 100% within a year. Here are a few S.M.A.R.T. goals that might support that initiative:

Publish 25 blog posts each month
Record a weekly podcast and accompanying SlideShare
Engage with 100 third-party publications monthly
As you can see, it would be hard to achieve a stretch goal without a structured digital marketing plan in place. Similarly, the S.M.A.R.T. goals would be random without a larger, galvanizing stretch goal.



2. Define your audience segments and buyer personas
----------------------------------------------------------

Next, it’s time to research your audience and create personas. This step is critical because developing a content strategy that targets the wrong audience wastes time and money.

Audience segments
For example, if you’re in the financial services industry, one audience segment might be recent college graduates with more than $10,000 in debt who might be interested in refinancing. Or, it could be females with a net worth of $100,000 or more who are candidates for investing advice. Another segment might be families with a net worth of $10 million or more who are prime candidates for estate planning guidance.

An audience segment may not reveal the characteristics of buyer personas within that market, but it’s a useful framework to help you make your marketing more targeted. And the more targeted your marketing, the more likely it is to be effective (and efficient).

Data sources
There are many different types of criteria and demographic data you could use to segment your audience, depending on what your business sells and how diverse its reach is. For instance, buyer persona characteristics for B2C marketing might include:

Age
Gender
Location
Family status
Income level
Disposable income
Interests
Goals
Products desired
Product attributes
Pain points
Occupation
For B2B marketing, on the other hand, you might include:

Job title
Department
Division
Industry
Company size
Decision maker
Business goals
Impact of goals
Pain points
Effect of frustrations
Products desired
Product features
Audience insights
Fortunately there are plenty of places to glean audience insights, including:

Search data
Social media platforms
Email marketing data
Google Analytics data
Behavioral intelligence
Survey data
Analyst reports
Customer interviews
Interviews with salespeople
Interviews with support teams
Use that data to define your target audience segments and then create personas within each segment.

Buyer personas
A buyer persona is defined as a semi-fictional representation of an ideal customer based on common audience attributes. These may include pain points, needs, interests, demographic information, as well as other factors as listed above.

The main difference between a buyer persona and an audience segment is that buyer personas force you to think about your audience as an individual, rather than a group. And within each segment, you may have multiple buyer persona examples.

While you develop your personas, think about your customers’ core problems as well as the outcomes they want to achieve. Furthermore, consider the external influences that may impact how your audience acts. These might include social movements, political beliefs, laws, where they live or work, etc.

It’s easier to influence your audience when you know what they care about.

3. Conduct a content audit and gap analysis
----------------------------------------------------------


Learn how to conduct a content audit to identify and inventory all existing brand content and to evaluate its effectiveness. An audit helps you to determine if you have:

Competitor content gaps
Customer interest content gaps
Missing steps in the customer journey
Irrelevant content
Underperforming pages
When reviewing and assessing your content, it isn’t enough to know who your customers are. In order to have a strong and differentiated content strategy, you should also do a competitive analysis. 

However, don’t just look at your direct competitors’ content strategy. Major e-commerce brands often lose traffic to review sites and industry blogs with a strong SEO strategy. Financial services firms often lose search engine rankings to lead generation websites and publications. So, take note of all the websites vying for your customers’ attention within the Google SERPs.

For example, an inventory of your blog posts might reveal that some are outdated, not aligned with business goals, or not performing well in organic search. You can then decide whether you want to:

Delete irrelevant posts
Update outdated content
Combine multiple posts into a consolidated, more valuable post
Create completely new content pieces


4. Map content needs throughout the customer journey
----------------------------------------------------------

The Conversion Funnel
Once you define your audience segments and buyer personas, map the customer journey of each persona throughout the buyer’s funnel, including:

What do potential customers do?
Where do they go online?
What information do they want?
How is the content presented?
funnel diagram
Additionally, what questions do they ask themselves when they search? Alfred L. Yarbus, a Russian psychologist, conducted a study on eye movements. Participants were asked to look at paintings. Yarbus asked a certain question, then he tracked the eye movements of each participant.

What he found was that participants looked at completely different parts of the painting depending on the question they were asked beforehand.

Essentially, our brains are hardwired to find solutions to specific questions we ask ourselves. So, it’s critical that you strive to answer your audience’s burning questions all the way through the conversion funnel.

Targeting stages of the funnel
For example, a blog post may target a generic head-term in your industry to capture those just beginning the buyer’s journey. The post may answer key questions and offer potential solutions. Or, it may be an entertaining or intriguing piece meant to expand reach and capture attention.

content marketing funnel stages
Another blog post may target the middle of the funnel when the prospect has done their initial research and begins to engage with various brands or vendors.

At this point, the prospect may want more detailed and customized content focused on specific products, services, solutions, features and benefits.

Finally, at the bottom of the funnel, prospects want to compare options and make a final decision. To turn their curiosity into a conversion, provide an ROI calculator, detailed case studies or offer a free trial or coupon.

5. Conduct keyword research
----------------------------------------------------------

Whether your primary goal is lead generation or to increase ecommerce sales, you need traffic. But you won’t attract thousands of visitors to your site with good content alone. You need to optimize for keywords too.

Keyword research is the foundation of an SEO-focused content strategy because it guides you to the most valuable topics and keeps you organized. With thorough keyword research, you’ll be able to cover topics thoroughly without writing the same blog post five times. That means more traffic, more engagement, and more conversions.

Where do you begin? Use tools like Ahrefs and Semrush to uncover the topics in which your audience is most interested. You can also use SEO tools to spot your competitors’ top pages as well as the head terms and long-tail keywords driving most of their traffic.

Confirm the questions that your audience asks online, as well. Use tools such as Answer the Public and Answer Socrates or Google Question Hub. This gives you the strategic opportunity to be first to answer an important question. You can also confirm the “People Also Ask” (PAA) boxes in the Google SERPs for your target keywords.

Firstly, you’ll need to identify relevant keyword phrases and questions to target, and you note the search intent behind each one. Then, it’s time to create content.



6. Brainstorm content ideas
---------------------------------
Next, use your list of keywords to brainstorm new content ideas. But, how do you create unique, usable content when there are more than 4.2 billion web pages competing for attention?

Fortunately, the vast majority of indexed web pages are terrible. So, take that golden opportunity to iterate and improve upon what already exists!

A key to producing great content is to use a process of iterative ideation. As author Steven Johnson shows us in his book, Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation, the best innovative ideas are typically iterative, take shape over periods of time, and often occur in the realm of the “adjacent possible” (relying directly on previous knowledge).

So, don’t waste time looking for the one thing that hasn’t been written. Instead, brainstorm new ways to approach an old dusty topic, or cross-pollinate two separate ideas to forge something unique.

Not sure where to begin? Tools like Buzzsumo can provide insight into engagement, while Ahrefs and Semrush are excellent for shedding light on keyword rankings, backlinks, and traffic.

After you identify the top performing content for each keyword, knock it out of the park with something 10X better. Here are several ways to improve your existing content:

Leverage proprietary data
Visualize boring topics with graphics
Simplify or break down a complex topic
Combine related content into a comprehensive guide
Use explainer videos within your copy
Create something 10X more entertaining


7. Choose a content management system
----------------------------------------------------------

If you plan to produce a massive amount of content, you’ll need a robust Content Management System (CMS). Your CMS allows you to create, organize, publish, and store various kinds of content, including blog posts, audio, video, PDFs, etc.

Fortunately, there are plenty of options to choose from depending upon your needs.

For large ecommerce stores, for example, there’s Magento, which supports more than 200,000 online stores across 20+ industries. Sitecore is often used for enterprise websites that need strong security and scalability. WordPress has the largest market share of any CMS. And Drupal is a good option if you need extra customization and data management capabilities.


8. Establish a content development process
----------------------------------------------------------

Your content won’t create itself, so you need a clearly defined, repeatable, structured content strategy development process. The right methodology ensures that you always create high-quality, high-value content.

Your process should include:

Keyword research
Title
Content brief
Draft
Edit
Revisions
Media selection
Layout
Optimization
Browser preview
Publish
QA
Clarify who will be responsible for each task and by what deadline. In addition, standardize your content tech stack and workflow. Beyond your CMS, there’s project management software, grammar checking software, SEO software, and much more.



9. Implement a content calendar
----------------------------------------------------------

A content calendar is much more than a simple schedule. It’s also an organizational structure that aligns your content team with your broader marketing tactics and goals.

An effective content calendar should tie each piece of output back to your S.M.A.R.T. goals so you can track performance. It also helps you prioritize items that are likely to have the greatest impact. Depending upon your organization’s goals, your content calendar should include the following types of information:

Title of Content Piece
Target Audience Segment or Persona
Content Format
Author
Content Brief Due Date
Draft Deadline
Editing Deadline
Design & Development Deadlines
Publication Date
Target SEO Keyword(s)
Associated Keyword Query Volume
Comments or Other Information
Do you publish multi-format content such as a blog post that includes a video or an infographic? Then, create a separate line item in your calendar for each component.

Your editorial calendar should be accessible online by your internal team. Keep it clean and skimmable so it’s easy to see what you published, what’s still in process, and what’s on the back burner.

For keyword-focused content, track scores from SEO tools such as Clearscope, MarketMuse, SurferSEO, and similar alternatives to ensure content meets your threshold.

A content calendar keeps the entire content production process on track. It ensures that deadlines are met and that last-minute “fire drills” can be averted. Your content schedule helps the entire team stay organized and on pace to hit your goals.

Strategically plan and organize your content for greater efficiency.



10. Prioritize quality over quantity
----------------------------------
If your audience gives you their attention, don’t squander the opportunity to connect by serving them lazy content. Make your brand stand out with exceptional quality.

Want to rank well in organic search? You must provide valuable content. That advice is straight from Google. In fact, it’s the guiding principle behind most successful content strategies for several reasons:

You won’t waste resources on thin content that nobody will engage with
You’ll focus on actionable content that drives traffic and leads
Stakeholders will see you as an industry expert which can earn media mentions and natural backlinks
You’ll keep visitors on your site longer
You’ll increase brand affinity
But, what is valuable, usable content? It depends on your industry, but it could be unique market research, expert advice in a podcast, a listicle of resources, beautiful photos, or even emotionally engaging content and videos.

The bottom line? Give your readers something they’ll love and share.



11. Publish long-form content
------------------------------

When it comes to Google rankings and organic search traffic, long-form content such as blogging almost always wins. According to a study by Semrush, long-form content generates 3X more traffic, 4X more shares, and 3.5X more backlinks.

There are several reasons for this.

Firstly, long-form content often ranks for more keywords than shorter content since it covers a subject in more depth. You can answer more questions, naturally include more long-tail keywords, and structure the content to capture the featured snippet.

Secondly, long-form content tends to get shared more frequently and earn more backlinks. For instance, a running website is more likely to link to a 2,500 word blog post about how to choose the best running shoe than a 500 word article.

Thirdly, long-form content lends itself well to multiple content formats in a single content piece, making the content more engaging and link-worthy.

Finally, it’s easier to build content marketing funnels within long-form content. You’ll have more room to include CTAs on the page that drive your readers to the next step in the buyer’s journey, whether that’s an article or a landing page.

Reach more customers. Build brand affinity. Drive revenue.


12. Build expertise, authority & trust (E-A-T)
------------------------------------------------
Brand trust influences conversions, customer loyalty, SEO, and more. That’s why it’s critical to build trust by showcasing your brand’s natural expertise throughout your content strategy.

For example, if your company sells photography supplies, you should stick to topics related to photography rather than optometry.

From a search perspective, however, there’s more to it.

You’ve probably heard of the concept of expertise, authority and trust (E-A-T), which is a set of principles foundational to Google search. E-A-T is not a direct ranking signal. However, many ranking factors within Google’s algorithm are meant to measure it in some way. Therefore, improving your expertise, authority and trust can indirectly benefit an enterprise SEO program. For example:

People are more likely to link to content they trust, and links are one way Google measures trust.
Expert authors cover topics more thoroughly, which means they’re more likely to mention relevant topics and co-occurring keyword phrases.
Google continues to improve its understanding of entities which helps them recognize well-known authors.
This becomes especially important as you create content for people who may not yet know about your brand or product.

Sometimes, your eyes can get big when you see the search volume behind a top-of-funnel query. But ask yourself this: does it really make sense for my brand to talk about this? If it doesn’t, you’ll need to either find an angle that connects, or look for a different opportunity.



13. Evoke an emotional response
-----------------------------------

A smart content strategist understands that the most impactful content works on a subconscious level.

Here’s why:

The human brain subconsciously processes 11 million bits of sensory information each second. Compare that to only 40 bits per second on a conscious level. In fact, Harvard Professor Gerald Zaltman estimates that 95% of our decisions are made subconsciously.

So how do you tap into your customers’ subconscious mind?

Emotions.

The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio studied people who couldn’t feel emotions due to brain damage. Those individuals struggled to make decisions because they endlessly waffled between options, as they couldn’t feel strongly enough about one option versus another. In other words, humans need emotions to take action because we base our decisions on feelings.

Emotions also prompt higher engagement. Jonah Berger, a Marketing Professor at the Wharton School, explained that people are more likely to share content that triggers an emotional response, especially a high-arousal emotion.

Emotional content draws in users, prompts action, and encourages sharing. What’s more, all of those things are a recipe for earning natural backlinks that improve organic visibility.



14. Plan a variety of content types
----------------------------------------

Make an effort to vary the types of content marketing in your content strategy. Each demographic consumes media differently, so keep your buyer personas in mind while you brainstorm.

Even if your target audience segments are relatively the same demographic you should still mix things up. For example, some people prefer visual content, some are auditory learners, and others prefer to read text.

Consider using some of the following formats in your content strategy:

Blog Post
Article
Whitepaper
Ebook
Guide
Case Study
Interview
Checklist
Template
News
Topic Cluster
Infographic
Data Visualization
Survey
Presentation
Video
Podcast
Demo
Tool
Etc.
Develop a content creation strategy with different learning types and scalability in mind.

For example, you could create a survey as your base piece of content. From the insights that you collect, you can shape the takeaways into everything from infographics to videos, podcasts, blog posts, checklists, templates, social content, presentations, etc. 

And don’t forget to distribute the different content types appropriately. For example, if you created a video, upload it and optimize it for YouTube. In this way, you’ll have a broader reach. A prospective customer may find your content, for example, in your blog, but another may run across the video version in YouTube or a podcast episode in Spotify.

Think broadly in terms of repurposing content to maximize your SEO ROI.



15. Define your content distribution and amplification strategy
------------------------------------------------------------------

Your content strategy doesn’t end when you publish a blog post or a video. Think about it. You’ve invested a great deal of time and money to produce compelling content that you expect to deliver results. So, don’t share it one time and move on to the next project.

Instead, build amplification into your content strategy process. Share posts multiple times across several social platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn. Execute blogger outreach to online publishers, and even other businesses to promote your blog posts, graphics or videos. Also, don’t be afraid to run paid ads. Just make sure you understand the ROI before you go on a spending spree.

Content distribution is a powerful way to increase website traffic. If you’re smart about content promotion and distribution, you’ll see a compound effect from your marketing efforts. One publication may share it with its audience, who in turn then share it with their individual networks, etc.
